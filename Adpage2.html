    <p style="color: #00cccc">
    --->People living by the coast have been diving for as long as humankind has existed – and for as long as man has been able to swim. In the Arab world, there were pearl divers, men who made a living looking for pearls underwater. Of course, coastal folk around the globe also dived for food, their very lives depending on their diving skills.
The history of modern scuba diving can be traced to warfare, and much of the advancements in diving and diving techniques arose from the needs of navies, who’d constantly have to go on rescue operations. Over the centuries and over the years, diving equipment has become more and more sophisticated and hi-tech, though the peculiar dangers associated with diving still remain.
It was, however, the contributions of the French pair of Cousteau and Gagnan that helped take scuba diving into the modern world, made it accessible and, in turn, hugely popular with the masses, with the invention of the demand regulator (see equipment). As scuba diving’s popularity grew, so did the need for a safety code and regulations, and organizations that specialized in instructing and certifying divers. This led to the formation of the National Association of Underwater Instructors, in 1961, and the Professional Association of Diving Instructors, in 1966.

    <p style="color: #ff66ff">--->Corals and marine life are national treasures that must be preserved. Corals are also delicate living specimens, so while going diving, please observe the ‘Green Coral Code’:
1. Do not touch, or walk on, living coral – it will die.
2. While wearing fins, try as much as possible to keep your feet away from the reefs; a kick from your flipper will likely result in an abrupt spill of water, which is enough to permanently damage the coral.
3. While diving, try and control your descent; a hard landing on the corals can destroy them.
4. The coral is a living organism – do not break pieces of it from a reef. Picking up corals is strictly prohibited and is punishable with heavy fines. Do bear in mind that it is also illegal to export dead coral – even if it is just fragments of coral lying around on a beach.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #0066ff; font-family: Charcoal;background-color: #000000">EQUIPMENT</h2>
    <p style="color: #cc0000">Gear for modern scuba diving is made up of one (or more) gas cylinder secured to the diver’s back. This gas tank is joined to an air hose and the demand (or diving) regulator – this latter device controls the flow of air, so that the air pressure in the diver’s lungs is the same as the pressure of the water. Among other gear/equipment used in diving is the buoyancy control device (BCD), basically an inflatable jacket that controls your buoyancy by adding or releasing air.</p>
